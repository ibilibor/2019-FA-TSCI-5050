#' Please copy this file to `config.R`, edit that copy, and copy it over to
#' the working directory whenever you check out this project. This is just an
#' example of what computer-specific variables should be set. A file needs to be 
#' called `config.R` in order to be used as a source of configuration 
#' information by our scripts

#' Do you know what character is used to delimit your files? Usually it's either
#' comma or tab, but it could be anything. If you're not sure, leave this 
#' commented out, and the scripts will try to guess it for you.
